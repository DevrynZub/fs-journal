# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git is used so peers and others can share information on code and projects they are working on. It makes it easier to share code and work through things due to being able to upload it with ease. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make Directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > pseudo-classes allow you to add a certain style to CSS text. A common one I would use would be hover, being able to style the way my mouse hovers over something to change it in different ways to stand out. 

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > specificity is when writing in css or code it helps determine what rule should be applied if multiple rules are targeting the same element. 

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > using !important, changes the specificity of what you assigned !important too. Overusing it could cause issues if you are always trying to change the specificity. If using bootstrap it may not always work if your documents are not setup correctly.  

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > 3 components of a CSS are selector, property and value. These will define the class and add style depending on what you choose with each component. 

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > |Good design and layout is everything. A website that isn't neat can become hard to navigate. Making sure accessibility options are available is a great design. Anything of importance on the page needs ro stand out, so adding certain color or text to help people be drawn to that part of the page. 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframe is used mostly with UX designs to determine the layout of features, useability, flow and page layout, along with colors and images, before the code is written. Wireframes also save a lot of time and are very cost effective. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Wiresframes are very valuable, putting the time into the design, layout and being the same page with your team or client before starting the code can save a lot of time and money. Being that wireframes are cheaper and easier to use it should hopefully save time on the coding side.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Display flex property allows you to move your code around to make it look better on a page, such as being able to have code flex to different parts of the page over being stacked. 

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Changing the body property in CSS changes the size of the box model, this is done by changing the values in css with margins or padding.
