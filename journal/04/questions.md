# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > async vs sync code has a key difference. async is something that happens over time, typically with an await attached to it, where sync happens in real time without delay.

02. What is an event listener?

  > event listeners update code from the controller as things update. 

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > REST = REpresentational State Transfer, in simple turns its basically the way an API lays out and looks. 

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > |a callback itself isn't anything other then a way to define using javascript functions, it can help to use callbacks with java to produce a result in time. 

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > a promise in javascript is similar to that of real life, either we will do something in the function or it will get rejected, a promise is seen as an object. to catch an error, you will want to use promise.then to catch an error. 

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > Get, post and delete

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application program interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > the function either needs to be async or sync to have await work correctly when talking to a server/api

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > the purpose of encapsulation is to have the ability to have a class imbedded with java and protect data. 

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > the page was not found, it did not load the page and content
