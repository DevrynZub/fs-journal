# CSS

Different Selectors

Class 
ID - mainly JS

margin - outside of element

    1 argument applies to entire element

text shadow, good for use over an image as well
display: flex
flexbox editior in devtools to change display on page
object fit can help with image distortion, fits within the assigned h/w
object will allow you to make adjustments to the image in different ways 
border-radius adjusts the border of the element 
font weight adjusts boldness (h1 tag may override making it bolder)
font size - em for changing size


background size: cover will stop images from warping 
background-position - 
background-repeat - doesnt repeat 
background images will not have a width due to taking up entire row

:root sets variables to be used throughout css. Will change all variables in the root throughout the reference of that variable, 

:roo{
    color-name: #color;
}

background-color: (var--)

write media rules at the bottom, any rules we add in the media rule will occur when the screen is below this size

@media (max-width: 768px){
.class created{
    border-left: none
    border-right: none
    border-top: px
    border-bottom: px
}
}
