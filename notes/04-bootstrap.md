# Bootstrap
containers - rows - columns ALWAYS

container - holds all of the grids
    rows within bootstrap are default flexbox
    multiple rows within a container 
    each row had 12 units and can be split which then holds there own html
    class names on a div are how you would create a container (col)


Code for Bootstrap
    link bootstrap - link:BS5

header - class=container
    section or div = class=row 
        class=col-6
.col-(number) 
bootstrap has a lot of utility classes that can be used
    Such as justify
    d-flex for flexbox
    container-fluid removes margins 
    bootstrap has a way to change colors, bg.
    dont add margin to any bootstrap columns on the x axis 
    padding is fine to add p-(1-5)
    fs-(1-5) for changing font size

    **Checkpoint 
        breakpoints in code matching a certain dimension
        check breakpoint on bootstrap website to make certain items disappear on mobile 
        d-none - no longer display add breakpoint so the text doesnt just gt removed on all pages
        d-md-block - default to display block
        swapping order of certain columns, make sure to use order

    stick-top, will cause the header element to move with the direct parent 
    class - img-fluid, making images not spilling outside of the column. 
    rounded class will do the same thing as border radius but with bootstrap
    col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4
    button classes - btn, btn color, 
    section.row>col-12
