# Bootstrap

container - holds all of the grids
    rows within bootstrap are default flexbox
    multiple rows within a container 
    each row had 12 units and can be split which then holds there own html
    class names on a div are how you would create a container (col)


Code for Bootstrap
    link bootstrap - link:BS5

header - class=container
    section or div = class=row 
        class=col-6
.col-(number)

    Such as justify
    d-flex for flexbox
    container-fluid removes margins 
    bootstrap has a way to change colors, bg.
